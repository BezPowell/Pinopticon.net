The global pandemic certainly de-railed my plans of posting content to this site on a regular basis. Fortunately, I have not been entirely idle as the world seemingly sinks ever faster into madness and have several projects on the go at the moment. Alongside teaching myself the rust programming language and game development (more on this later), I have also begun writing a online book on web development.

<a href="https://bezpowell.github.io/building_websites_for_beginners/">Building Websites for Beginners</a> aims to provide a gentle introduction to building websites for complete beginners. It is currently in a very early stage with only the first few chapters written, but the plan is to keep adding to it as and when I have time and to write everything in the open on github. When complete, it should cover the basics of HTML, CSS and Javascript alongside the basics of accessibility and front-end performance.

Any feedback from this early version would be much appreciated and can be sent via the <a href="/contact">Contact page</a>.
