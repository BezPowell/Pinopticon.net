Welcome, dear reader, to Pinopticon.net. I'm Berwyn Powell, and this is my personal website. It showcases two of my favourite hobbies: [Photography](@/photography/_index.md) and [Philosophical writing](@/philosophy/index.md). It also hosts a [Blog](@/blog/_index.md) where I write about things I think you'll find interesting; this is usually photography, philosophy, or web related, but I have been known to ramble on with very little provocation.

Being a professional web developer, I'm also very interested in making websites which are as accessible and inclusive as possible. I've tried to ensure that this website works well for as wide a variety of people as possible, regardless of physical ability or device being used. I'd like to think that I've done a good job at this, but if you have any suggestions for how I could improve the site please [get in touch](@/contact/index.md).
